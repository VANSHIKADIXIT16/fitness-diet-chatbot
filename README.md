# fitness-diet-chatbot 

A **Streamlit-based chatbot** that provides personalized **diet and exercise recommendations** based on user input, such as workout routine, dietary habits, and daily activities.  

## **Features**  
**Personalized Suggestions** – Get diet and workout plans based on your lifestyle  
**User-Friendly UI** – Built with **Streamlit** for easy interaction  
**Fast & Lightweight** – Runs efficiently with minimal setup 

## **How you can use it** 
**As it's not too great yet so you have to type same response twice, keep your name as first letter being capital and other being small also, don't leave space afterward, but I guess the actual problem is writing your response twice. Will try my best to not mess such things up next.**
